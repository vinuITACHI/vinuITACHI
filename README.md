Hi there, I'm Vinod 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm passionate about technology, coding, AI, cybersecurity, and constantly learning new things.  

Here's a little about me:

🚀 **About Me**  
🧑‍💻 I'm a Full Stack Developer specialized in React, Next.js, NestJS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.  

🤖 **AI Enthusiast:** I can set up AI models locally using third party tool/repos with Open source models for image,chat and video generation. I enjoy experimenting with **open-source AI models** (e.g., LLaMA, Stable Diffusion, SDXL, and text-to-video models) for creative and practical applications.  

🛡️ I'm also a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v11) with strong knowledge of offensive security, email security, and secure coding.  

🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Advanced algorithms, cloud computing, DevOps practices, and AI model fine-tuning for local deployments.  

💼 **I’m working on:** Secure full-stack applications, AI-based image/video generation setups, building email security analysis tools (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MTA-STS), and self-hosted business email servers.  

🎯 **Goals for 2025:** Contribute to a major open-source **AI + security or DevOps project**, and master advanced AI model deployment (local and cloud).  

⚡ **Fun fact:** I enjoy gaming, watching anime, and experimenting with AI image/video generation just for fun.
